PART 1

Simulate the effects of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism that leads to sickle cell genetic disease.
 
The program identifies and returns the amino acid sequence of the DNA using the
amino acid SLC code.
E.g DNA Input: ATTATTATT.
Output: III (representing: Isoleucine, Isoleucine, Isoleucine ).
 
The program will identify 5 different Amino acids present in the seqaunce.
These amino acids are 'Isoleucine', 'Leucine', 'Valine', 'Phenylalanine', 'Methionine' every other amino acid will be called 'Amino acid x'.
 
PART 2

In this task i was given a dna string in DNA.txt file.
I was tasked to find the mutation 'a' and replace the mutation with 'A' and save the results in a .txt file called NormalDNA.txt.
I was also tasked to replace mutation 'a' with 'T' and save the results in a .txt file called mutatedDNA.txt.
All .txt files were tested for amino acids present and printed in the console.
The place of mutation 'a' in DNA.txt file where also printed to the console.
